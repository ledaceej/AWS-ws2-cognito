In this workshop, we will build microservice Java springboot application. And this workshop not only instruct to build application but also lets you integrate with multi AWS service to test the application end to end. 

There are some service you will you to complete this workshop, that are Cognito, Simple Notification Service, Secrete Manager

- Secrete Manager helps you manage, retrive, and rotate database credentials, API keys,... throught out their lifecycles

- Simple Notification Service sends notification in two way A2A and A2P. A2A provides high throughput, push-based, many to many messaging between distributed system, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. A2P fucntionality lets you send messages to customer with SMS text, push notifications and email
